# silhouette

**Description:**

- utilizes my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core microservice functionality.

This service and stores additional user data that is not stored in the identity service for my home site.

For example:

- preferences
- address
- phone

**Name:** Since this data is what builds out a user's profile on the site, ie, it defines their shape, it is called silhouette.
